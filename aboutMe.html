            Hi, I’m Juan Baltazar.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a Full Stack Developer stuck in the body of a CPA. After 11 years as an accounting professional, 
            I decided to pursue what brings me joy and fulfillment: coding, problem solving, and building stuff. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On 12/31/2018 I was laid off from the only job I knew as an adult. What some may think of as an unfortunate event,
            I looked at as a new opportunity. I was reminded of the movie “Up in the Air”, and what George Clonney’s character 
            told J.K Simmons’ character. “How much did they first pay you to give up on your dreams?” I decided that enough was
            enough and I enrolled in the Thinkful boot camp. I took my enjoyment of creating macros that I learned while working 
            as an accountant and I am doing what makes me happy, finally.   
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides coding, some of my interests include reading the newspaper, music, sports (fantasy and otherwise), motorcycles, 
            trying to make people laugh, how to be a better father and husband, and how to be a better person.
